Hello! This is my first project, Ubuntermux-Installer! This script allows you to install Ubuntu 24.04 on termux! 
Currently supported Desktop environments:
*XFCE
*GNOME
*MATE
*Windows 10 theme (KDE) 
*Windows 11 Theme (Gnome) 
*macOS Big Sur theme (Xfce) 
*Cinnamon Desktop (Beta2 only)

-How to install it yourself-
type these commands in Termux:
wget ""
bash Install.sh



Note that this project isn't exactly mine; this belongs to @23xvx and his original Termux-Ubuntu-Installer project.
Thanks to him! This project only exists to fix the problem with the installation of Cinnamon desktop.
