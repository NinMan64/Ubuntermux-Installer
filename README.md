Hello! This is my first project, Ubuntermux-Installer! This script allows you to install Ubuntu 24.04 on termux! 
Currently supported Desktop environments:
*XFCE
*GNOME
*MATE
*Windows 10 theme (KDE) 
*Windows 11 Theme (Gnome) 
*macOS Big Sur theme (Xfce) 
Cinnamon desktop support coming in Beta 2!

-How to install it yourself-
First, go to this page and go to tags.
Second, go to the latest version of The installer. 
Third, download the  file.
Fourth, go to termux and type in termux-setup-storage if you haven't already.
Fifth, Move the file to the Termux app by typing in "mv ~/storage/downloads/Install.sh ~". 
Finally, execute the file by typing in "bash Install.sh". 


Note that this project isn't exactly mine; this belongs to @23xvx and his original Termux-Ubuntu-Installer project.
Thanks to him! This project only exists to fix the problem with the installation of Cinnamon desktop.
